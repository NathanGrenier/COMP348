# Questions
1. Calculate average function: I don't know what to do with the course semester. They're all the same. What do I display?
2. Display Student Record Function: How do you sort by course name then number? Basically, how to sort by 2 elements
3. Calculate average function: Do we specify what course to calculate the average for, or just calculate the average of all classes?

# TODO
 - Refactor some code. Instead of using vectors, convert the vectors to maps where the key is the id. 
 - Doesn't handle wrong student IDs (crashes)
