# TODO
- Test the functions
- Clean up the code (make smaller functions)
- Handle the unknowns about the assignment:
    1. Does the shift value take a hyphen in the command line?
    2. Does the size flag specify the max size of an inner array?
    3. Should the filter function print a new line if it finds no mathces?
