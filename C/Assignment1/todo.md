# TODO
- Test the functions
- Clean up the code (make smaller functions)
#### - Handle the unknowns about the assignment:
    1. Does the shift value take a hyphen in the command line? (the hyphen should mean negative)
    2. Should the filter function print a new line if it finds no mathces?
    3. The printf("%.0f") is rounding 2.5 down. Ask teacher. In reality, it sometimes rounds up and down. (Double rounding)
    4. How do I deal with arrays of size 0. Should they be set to null or just deleted from the 2D arary?
    5. Big question: Formatting of output. What functions should print a newline character and when. Do they print them when the array is zero?
